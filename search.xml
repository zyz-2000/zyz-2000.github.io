(Master)</h3></li><li>Sept. 2021 – Present</li><li><em>Project member</em></li><li>Transcriptome sequencing and differential expression analysis were used to compare the difference of RNA levels between <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> PAO1 under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, and a small RNA was screened and identified from the differentially expressed genes. Nanopore sequencing and Northern Blot were used to identify the small RNA and its major expression period. The length of the promoter region of the small RNA was determined by continuously reducing the length of its upstream promoter and constructing a fluorescent reporter gene. This small RNA was knocked out in <em>P. aeruginosa</em> PAO1 by gene knockout technology, and its effects on various phenotypes of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> PAO1 were determined. Multiple bioinformatics tools (TargetRNA, IntaRNA, CopraRNA) were used to predict small RNA targets, which were verified by EMSA. The nuclease that degrades this small RNA was predicted, purified and verified.</li><li>Responsible for the RNA-seq data analysis, Nanopore library construction and sequencing, construction of mutant strains and plasmid with reporter genes.<h3 id="Effect-of-desD-gene-on-the-synthesis-of-siderophore-by-endophytic-actinomyces-OsiSh-2-Bachelor"><a href="#Effect-of-desD-gene-on-the-synthesis-of-siderophore-by-endophytic-actinomyces-OsiSh-2-Bachelor" class="headerlink" title="Effect of desD gene on the synthesis of siderophore by endophytic actinomyces OsiSh-2.
