Nanopore sequencing and Northern Blot were used to identify the small RNA and its major expression period. The length of the promoter region of the small RNA was determined by continuously reducing the length of its upstream promoter and constructing a fluorescent reporter gene. This small RNA was knocked out in <em>P. aeruginosa</em> PAO1 by gene knockout technology, and its effects on various phenotypes of <em>P. aeruginosa</em> PAO1 were determined. Multiple bioinformatics tools (TargetRNA, IntaRNA, CopraRNA) were used to predict small RNA targets, which were verified by EMSA.
